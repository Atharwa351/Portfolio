ðŸ”— [View Full Project on GitHub](https://github.com/Atharwa351/Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Time%20Series)

> **Built and compared ARIMA and Holt-Winters models to simulate time series forecasting of stock prices. Includes full pipeline: data cleaning, seasonal decomposition, cross-validation, model tuning, and forecast visualization.**

---

### â€¢ Tools & Tech Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- `statsmodels` (ARIMA, Holt-Winters)
- `pmdarima` for auto ARIMA tuning
- `TimeSeriesSplit` for rolling validation
- Error metrics: MSE, MAE, MAPE

---

### â€¢ Business Insight(s) Extracted:
- Visualized trend, seasonality, and noise with decomposition  
- Validated forecasting accuracy using multi-fold CV  
- Compared Holt-Winters vs ARIMA for 30-day rolling forecasts  

---

### â€¢ GTM or RevOps Applications:
- ðŸ“† Forecasting MRR, pipeline, or renewals from historical GTM data  
- ðŸ“‰ Simulating seasonal trends in sales, lead gen, or ad spend  
- ðŸŽ¯ Identifying optimal models for time-based decision support

### â€¢ Sample Outputs:

```python
# Sample metrics
ARIMA MAPE â‰ˆ 3.8%
Holt-Winters MAPE range: 3.7%â€“10.6%
30-day forecast plotted on top of real closing prices

### ðŸ“ˆ TCS Stock Forecasting â€“ ARIMA & Holt-Winters

Forecasted 30-day trends using ARIMA and Holt-Winters models. Cross-validated forecasts and simulated seasonal effects on close prices.

- Tools: Python, statsmodels, pmdarima, matplotlib
- GTM Use Case: Forecasting sales, pipeline, or churn over time
- Insight: ARIMA outperformed Holt-Winters with MAPE â‰ˆ 3.8%
