# 🎓 Admission Chance Prediction – Logistic Regression Model

## 🎯 Objective
To predict a student’s likelihood of being admitted to a university based on GPA, test scores, and recommendation strength. Built using classification techniques.

## 🧠 Business Use Case
- Simulate university selection engine  
- Help candidates self-assess competitiveness  
- Support academic ops with data-driven selection policy

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- Python (scikit-learn)  
- Logistic Regression, KNN  
- Confusion matrix, accuracy, ROC AUC

## 📊 Key Visuals
- `confusion_matrix.png` – Classifier performance  
- `roc_curve.png` – AUC comparison  
- `gpa_vs_admit_prob.png` – Predictive insights

## ✅ Results
- Logistic regression outperformed KNN (accuracy: 82%)  
- High precision on positive admits  
- Feature importance: GPA > GRE > SOP rating
