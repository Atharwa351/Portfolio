# 💼 Salary Prediction – Linear Regression Model

## 🎯 Objective
To predict employee salary based on features like education, experience, and role level using a linear regression model. The goal is to simulate compensation benchmarking in HR analytics.

## 🧠 Business Use Case
- Estimate fair salary bands based on key inputs  
- Support HR or RevOps teams in offer benchmarking  
- Identify drivers of salary disparity across roles

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib)  
- Linear Regression  
- R² Score, RMSE, residual plots

## 📊 Key Visuals
- `actual_vs_predicted.png` – Model fit  
- `residual_plot.png` – Error distribution  
- `correlation_matrix.png` – Feature strength

## ✅ Results
- R² score: 0.87 → model explains 87% of variance  
- Strongest predictor: Years of Experience  
- Recommended inclusion of categorical features for higher fidelity

## 📂 Files
- `salary_model.ipynb` – Code and evaluation  
- `salary_data.csv` – Sample dataset  
- `visuals/` – Plots for interpretation
