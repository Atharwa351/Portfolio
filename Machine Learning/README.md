# 🤖 Machine Learning – Lead Conversion Classifier

## 🎯 Objective
To predict whether a lead is likely to convert into a customer using historical CRM data. The model supports **sales prioritization** and **RevOps funnel optimization**.

## 🧠 Business Use Case
- Prioritize high-likelihood MQLs
- Improve SDR efficiency and pipeline quality
- Embed predictive scores in CRM for smarter outreach

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- **Language**: Python (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib)
- **Models Used**: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve

## 📊 Key Visuals
- `confusion_matrix.png`: Model performance visualization  
- `model_accuracy.png`: Model comparison chart  
- `roc_curve.png`: AUC analysis (optional)

## ✅ Results
- Achieved 83% accuracy with KNN (k=5)  
- Confusion matrix: high true positive rate  
- Recommending KNN as deployment candidate for CRM scoring  

## 📂 Files
- `ml_model.ipynb` – Model training and evaluation
- `leads_dataset.csv` – Sample anonymized lead data
- `visuals/` – Confusion matrix, accuracy, and ROC plots
