# Customer Intent Classification ‚Äì Image-Based Modeling with MNIST

üß† *Built a digit classifier using the MNIST dataset to simulate how visual, structured, or pseudo-visual CRM data could be used to model customer intent, automate classification workflows, or assist SalesOps/CSOps teams in triaging large volumes of inbound inputs.*

---

### ‚Ä¢ Tools & Tech Used:
- Python, Keras (TensorFlow backend)  
- Dense neural network with ReLU and Softmax activations  
- Data reshaping, normalization, and categorical encoding  
- Matplotlib for visualizations

---

### ‚Ä¢ Business Insight(s) Extracted:
- Simulated classification from visual CRM-style inputs (e.g., scanned forms, ticket snapshots)  
- Achieved 97.5% accuracy after 20 epochs using basic Dense layers  
- Illustrated how lead form digitization or support ticket prediction models can be built from scratch

---

### ‚Ä¢ GTM or RevOps Applications:
- üîç Auto-classification of CRM form fields or handwritten tickets  
- üßæ Document digitization logic for invoice scanning or lead forms  
- üß† Categorization of survey data or field entries into ICP segments  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Ticket triage or routing logic for support/CSOps

### ‚Ä¢ Output Summary:
- Test Accuracy: 97.5%
- Model: Dense[128, ReLU] ‚Üí Dense[128, ReLU] ‚Üí Dense[10, Softmax]
- Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
- Optimizer: SGD

### ‚Ä¢ Visualizations:
- Training vs. validation loss curve  
- Sample digit predictions vs. actual labels  
- Prediction error distribution (via accuracy scoring)
