RevOps Trend Forecasting â€“ Manual Gradient Descent Optimizer
 Forecasting pipeline or revenue growth by manually modeling linear regression using gradient descent. Built for GTM teams that want to simulate trends from raw CRM exports.

â€¢ Tools & Tech Used:
Python (NumPy, matplotlib, statsmodels)
Jupyter Notebook
Custom gradient-based optimization logic

â€¢ Business Insight(s) Extracted:
Error convergence patterns in manual forecast modeling
Comparison with OLS regression (RÂ² = 0.88)
Use of slope/intercept to simulate future revenue or lead volume

â€¢ GTM / RevOps Application:
Forecasting revenue or SQL velocity over time
Modeling lift from campaign performance
Teaching junior analysts model fundamentals
Replacing black-box tooling with transparent logic

â€¢ Visualizations:
Gradient descent error reduction (slope/intercept)
Actual vs. predicted line overlay
OLS regression summary (included in notebook)
