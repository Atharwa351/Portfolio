##  Featured Projects

### [Laptop Conjoint Analysis – GTM Feature Prioritization (Python)](https://github.com/Atharwa351/Portfolio/tree/main/Financial%20Modelling/Conjoint%20Analysis/Laptop_Preference_Case_Study)
> *End-to-end project with self-collected survey data. Simulates product-market fit using conjoint-style analysis to guide pricing, bundling, and launch configuration strategy.*

- Tools: Python (Scikit-Learn, Regression, Isolation Forest)
- Insights: RAM, Price, Screen Size were most influential in preference modeling
- RevOps Relevance: Supports GTM teams in SKU design, tier pricing, and forecast alignment

Market Basket Analysis – Retail GTM Optimization (R)
Analyzed grocery transaction patterns using Apriori algorithm in R. Identified high-lift item combos (e.g., milk + yogurt + rolls) for promotional bundling, shelf layout, and cross-sell strategies.

Tools: R (arules, arulesViz, ggplot2)

Insights: Generated 200+ strong rules (confidence > 70%, lift > 1.5); “whole milk” emerged as a central hub item

RevOps Relevance: Supports revenue growth via combo offers, increased basket size (AOV), and optimized GTM campaigns


Customer LTV & Expense Forecasting (Python)
   Forecasts Customer Lifetime Value and monthly expenses from anonymized CRM-style data to support lead scoring, CAC reduction, and revenue planning in a RevOps context.
   Modeled CLTV and expense behavior using linear regression
   Identified value concentration in top 20% of customer base
   Used Python (Pandas, Sklearn, Statsmodels) and Jupyter for visual insights
   Delivered business-ready outputs: funnel skew detection, segment ROI analysis
   Use Case: GTM team uses LTV scores to prioritize leads and plan outreach velocity



###  [Sales Forecasting – Time Series Revenue Analysis (Python)](https://github.com/Atharwa351/Portfolio/tree/main/Financial%20Modelling/Sales%20Forecasting)
> *Week‑level forecasting of store revenue using ARIMA and ETS models — supports inventory planning (with 15% Q4 buffer), quota setting, and seasonal GTM mapping.*

- Tools: Python (Statsmodels, pmdarima), ETS, ARIMA  
- Metrics: MAE, MAPE (~3%), RMSE  
- RevOps Relevance: Demand forecasting, GTM campaign planning, stock alignment


### 📌 Salary Prediction – HR Compensation Benchmarking  
Created regression model using Python to predict salary based on education and experience. Informed equitable pay policy design.

### 📌 Admission Prediction – Academic Ops Modeling  
Used logistic regression to estimate admission chances. Built prototype tool to support data-driven selection policy.

### 🔵 RevOps Trend Forecasting – Manual Gradient Descent Optimizer  
Forecasted revenue/SQL trends using a custom-built gradient descent model to simulate lead velocity over time. Validated outputs using OLS regression (R² = 0.88). Useful for CRM data forecasting in early-stage GTM setups.  
**Tech:** Python, NumPy, statsmodels  
**RevOps Use Case:** Forecasting lead/revenue trends, modeling early pipeline dynamics
